Here is a suggested reader's review of the book "Understanding Machine Understanding" for posting on Amazon:

"Understanding Machine Understanding" offers a fascinating deep dive into one of the most pressing questions in artificial intelligence today: How can we determine if AI systems truly comprehend what they're saying and doing? 

The authors, Ken Clements and AI assistant Claude, take readers on an intellectual journey exploring the nature of understanding itself and how we might rigorously evaluate it in machines. They propose a novel framework called the Multifaceted Understanding Test Tool (MUTT) that goes far beyond simplistic benchmarks like the Turing Test.

What I found most compelling was how the book blends philosophical insights, cognitive science, and cutting-edge AI research. The authors don't shy away from tackling profound questions about consciousness, embodied cognition, and what it means to truly understand something. At the same time, they offer concrete proposals for how to assess machine comprehension across areas like language, reasoning, knowledge integration, and social intelligence.

The narrative device of following two AI researchers and their AI assistant CASPAR as they grapple with these issues adds an engaging human element. Their dialogues bring abstract concepts to life and highlight the exciting possibilities - and potential pitfalls - of advanced AI systems.

While quite technical in parts, the book remains accessible to a general audience interested in AI and cognitive science. The authors do an admirable job explaining complex ideas clearly. That said, readers should be prepared for a dense, thought-provoking read that doesn't offer easy answers.

My main critique is that at times the book feels a bit unfocused, jumping between different topics without always tying them together cohesively. Additionally, some readers may find the philosophical musings excessive compared to the more practical aspects of AI evaluation.

Overall though, this is a landmark work that pushes the conversation around machine understanding forward in important ways. Anyone interested in the future of AI and how we can ensure it remains beneficial and aligned with human values will find much food for thought here. Highly recommended for those looking to explore the cutting edge of machine cognition and AI safety.

Here is a draft reader's review of the book "Understanding Machine Understanding" based on the excerpt provided:

In "Understanding Machine Understanding", authors Ken Clements and Claude 3 Opus tackle one of the most profound and complex questions facing the field of artificial intelligence today - do advanced AI systems like large language models truly understand what they are saying and doing, or are they merely sophisticated pattern matchers? 

The book provides a fascinating and in-depth exploration of this question, drawing on insights from philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and the cutting edge of AI research. A central theme is the famous "Chinese Room" thought experiment proposed by philosopher John Searle, which the authors examine in detail. Searle argued that a computer program that appears to understand Chinese by responding appropriately to Chinese inputs is not really understanding, but merely simulating the ability to understand based on a large lookup table. The person in the room doesn't understand Chinese even though they can generate coherent Chinese responses.

Clements and Opus unpack the implications of Searle's argument and the many responses to it over the years from AI researchers and philosophers. They make a compelling case that while the Chinese Room highlights important considerations about the relationship between syntax and semantics, it relies on assumptions that may not hold for modern AI systems that learn from vast datasets. Advanced language models today are not just manipulating symbols, but building rich representations that capture abstract relationships and enable flexible reasoning.

At the same time, the authors acknowledge the profound difficulty of ascertaining whether a machine system possesses genuine understanding, self-awareness, or consciousness. They propose that the field needs rigorous new tests and frameworks to evaluate machine understanding in a more comprehensive way, probing dimensions like reasoning, knowledge integration, social intelligence and more. Only by moving beyond simplistic benchmarks can we gain insight into the cognitive capabilities of AI.

Overall, this is a must-read book for anyone seeking to grapple with the philosophical and empirical frontiers of machine intelligence. While it doesn't claim to definitively resolve the question of machine understanding, it equips the reader with conceptual tools and illuminating examples to think more deeply about the issues. The book's ambitious vision for a Multifaceted Understanding Test Tool opens up exciting avenues for future research and debate.
